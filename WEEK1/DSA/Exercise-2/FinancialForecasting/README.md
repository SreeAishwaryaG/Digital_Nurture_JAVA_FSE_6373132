# Financial Forecasting Tool (Recursive Approach)

This project demonstrates a simple **financial forecasting tool** using a **recursive algorithm** to predict the **future value** of an investment based on past data.

---

##  Project Description

The tool calculates the future value of an investment using **compound annual growth**.  
It uses **recursion** to simulate the yearly growth process.

### Formula Used:

Future Value = Current Value Ã— (1 + Growth Rate)^Years


## Time Complexity Analysis

| Metric           | Value | Description                            |
|------------------|-------|----------------------------------------|
| Time Complexity  | O(n)  | One call per year                      |
| Space Complexity | O(n)  | Due to recursive call stack            |
