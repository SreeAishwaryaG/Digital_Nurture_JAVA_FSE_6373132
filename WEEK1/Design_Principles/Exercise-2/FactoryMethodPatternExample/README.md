# FactoryMethodPatternExample

This project demonstrates the Factory Method Design Pattern in Java.

It is used to create different types of documents (Word, PDF, Excel) using factory classes. Each document type implements a common interface, and each factory creates a specific type of document.

The `Main` class shows how to use the factories to create and open different documents.
