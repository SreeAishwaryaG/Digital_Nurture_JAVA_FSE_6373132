**Benefits of SPA:**
- Faster user experience
- Seamless transitions
- Better client-side performance
- Reusable components (with frameworks like React)

### 🧾 What is React?

**React** is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building fast and interactive user interfaces.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Component-based structure
- Efficient updating with **Virtual DOM**
- Uses **JSX** for HTML-like syntax in JavaScript

|----------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Pages Loaded   | One page                      | Multiple pages               |
| Performance    | Fast after load               | Slower with full reloads     |
| Navigation     | Client-side                   | Server-side                  |
