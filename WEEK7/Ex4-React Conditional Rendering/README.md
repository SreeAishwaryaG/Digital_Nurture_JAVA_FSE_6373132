# React Conditional Rendering â€“ `ticketbookingapp`

## Description

This React application demonstrates the concept of **conditional rendering** to control what content is displayed to the user based on their login status. It highlights how to use **element variables**, **logical operators**, and **JSX expressions** to render components conditionally.

The application simulates a flight ticket booking system where:

- **Guest users** can only view flight details.
- **Logged-in users** can access the booking functionality.
- A **Login button** toggles the state to show the user-specific view.
- A **Logout button** reverts the state to show the guest view.

This lab provides a practical understanding of rendering logic in React and helps reinforce dynamic UI control based on user interaction or application state.
