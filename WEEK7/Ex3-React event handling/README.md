# React Event Handling â€“ `eventexamplesapp`

## Description

This project demonstrates how to handle events in React using both class-based and functional components. It covers key concepts such as synthetic events, binding with `this`, passing arguments to event handlers, and conditional rendering based on user interaction.

You'll build an interactive UI that includes:

- A counter component with increment and decrement buttons
- Handling multiple methods with a single event
- Event handler with parameters
- Synthetic event handling
- A currency converter component that calculates INR to Euro on form submission

The application showcases how React manages events differently from vanilla JavaScript using synthetic events and how to structure clean and modular event-driven components.
