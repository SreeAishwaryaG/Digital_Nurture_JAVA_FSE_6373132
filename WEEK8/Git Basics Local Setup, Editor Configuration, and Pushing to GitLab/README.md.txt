# Git Basics: Local Setup, Editor Configuration, and Pushing to GitLab

## Overview
This exercise demonstrates the basic workflow of configuring Git, integrating Notepad++ as the default Git editor, creating a local repository, committing a file, and pushing it to a remote GitLab repository.

## Steps Completed
1. Installed Git and verified installation using `git --version`.
2. Configured global username and email for Git commits.
3. Set Notepad++ as the default Git editor in Git configuration.
4. Created a new local repository named `GitDemo`.
5. Added a text file named `welcome.txt` with sample content.
6. Staged and committed the file to the local repository.
7. Created a new GitLab repository named `GitDemo`.
8. Linked the local repository to the remote GitLab repository.
9. Pushed the local `master` branch to the remote repository on GitLab.
10. Verified that the file is visible in the GitLab repository.

## Outcome
The file `welcome.txt` is now successfully stored in both the local Git repository and the remote GitLab repository. The setup is complete and ready for further Git operations such as pull, push, and commit.
