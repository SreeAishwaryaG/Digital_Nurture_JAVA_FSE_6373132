### ðŸ”¹ Exercise 1 â€“ Configuring a Basic Spring Application

In this exercise, a basic Spring application was created using **XML-based configuration**.  
Beans for `BookService` and `BookRepository` were defined in `applicationContext.xml`, and **setter-based Dependency Injection** was used to wire them.  
The Spring container was loaded using `ClassPathXmlApplicationContext` to demonstrate how Spring manages bean creation and dependency wiring via XML configuration.
