### ðŸ”¹ Exercise 3 â€“ Creating and Configuring a Maven Project

In this exercise, the project was configured using Maven.  
Dependencies for `spring-context`, `spring-aop`, and `spring-webmvc` were added to the `pom.xml` file.  
The `maven-compiler-plugin` was also configured to use Java 1.8.  
This setup ensures that the project is ready for developing Spring applications with proper build and dependency management.
