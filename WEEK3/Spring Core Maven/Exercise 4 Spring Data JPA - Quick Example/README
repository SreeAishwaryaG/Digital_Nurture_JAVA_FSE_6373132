# orm-learn

Demo project for Spring Data JPA and Hibernate

This project demonstrates the fundamentals of Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) using Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and Hibernate.

The application connects to a MySQL database and performs basic CRUD operations using a layered architecture:

- **Entity Layer**: Maps the `Country` table using JPA annotations.
- **Repository Layer**: Uses `JpaRepository` to interact with the database without writing SQL queries.
- **Service Layer**: Contains business logic and acts as a bridge between the controller and repository.
- **Main Application**: Bootstraps the application and fetches all country records using the service layer.
