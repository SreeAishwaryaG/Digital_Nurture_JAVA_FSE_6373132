### ðŸ”¹ Exercise 2 â€“ Implementing Dependency Injection

This exercise focused on **annotation-based Dependency Injection**.  
Using `@Component`, the classes were marked as Spring-managed beans, and `@Autowired` was used to inject the `BookRepository` into `BookService` automatically.  
The application used `AnnotationConfigApplicationContext` and `@ComponentScan` to load the beans without any XML file.  
This shows a modern, cleaner approach to Springâ€™s Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Management.
